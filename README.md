## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learn to get better with using grid and flexbox.. but just a little XD. Other than that reinforcing css and html helps too.

### Continued development

If I can master my CSS and HTMl that would be excellent. With theses challenges I do , I feel like I am.
